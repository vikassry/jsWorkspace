Each player starts with a fleet of 5 ships, of hole 5, 4, 3, 3, and 2.

There will be two grids. One is ocean grid and other one is target grid.

Each player places their ships horizontally or vertically on a 10x10 ocean grid; this is not visible to their opponent.

Player can't place his ship out side the ocean grid and also one ship can't be placed on the other ship.

Diagonal placement of ship is not allowed.

Players take turns to fire at positions on the grid, and get information about the shoot whether it has been hit or missed.

A ship is destroyed when every hole of a ship has been hit.

The winner is the first player to destroy their opponentâ€™s fleet.
